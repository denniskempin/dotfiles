# Personal dotfiles

Contains configuration for iterm2 and vscode on OSX, as well as fish shell configuration.

## Key bindings

The configs are trying to set up consistent key bindings for hyper + home-row keys for quick search functions.

- Hyper + t searches for files (e.g. fzf file search or quick open in vscode)
- Hyper + s searches for commands (e.g. command history in the shell or command palette in vscode)
